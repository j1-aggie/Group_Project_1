Outline
 1. Finalize and submit for approval of project<br />
    a. submit to instructors
 2. Collect data from data sources<br />
     a. clean data and put in a format that is usable
 3. Design Code<br />
 4. Analyze and Formulate Conclusions<br />
     a. go through as a team and formulate the conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis.
 5. Presentation Ready<br />
    a. go through as a team and make power point and then decide presentation 

Questions:

What attribute below contributes the most to the intensity of the Hurricane based on P-value analysis:     
    a. Did water temperature affect the intensity of Hurricane Harvey?<br />
    b. Did water salinity effect the intensity of Hurricane Harvey?<br />
    c. Did ambient air temperature affect the intensity of Hurricane Harvey?<br />
    d. Did air pressure affect the intensity of Hurricane Harvey?<br />
 
Initial null hypothesis (H0) is that sea water temperature is the most significant attribute unless our study proves otherwise.

Tasks

The first part of the project was for each team member to come up with ideas to the team.  As a team we chose to do an analysis on certain weather attributes as they correlate to the intensity of the storm.  Next we gathered the data and then the data was cleaned.  Each team member started to import the csv into a panda sheet and at some point we divided up to conquered multiple task at once as can be seen by the multiple notebooks in the github. Then we came together to create the powerpoint and work on presentation.
